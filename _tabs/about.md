Hi! I'm Josh, a compulsive project starter and occasional project finisher. 

When I'm not at my day job designing industrial telecommunication equipment, I can be found at home working on projects spanning keyboards, FPGAs, Car / CAN hacking, low cost RF, and educational talks and workshops. 

I can also be found out on the local mountain bike tracks trying to stay upright, with mixed success.

If you have any questions about anything I've worked on, or want to enquire about consulting availability, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@joshajohnson.com).
