Hi! I'm Josh, a compulsive project starter and occasional project finisher. 

When not at my day job, I can be found at home working on projects spanning keyboards, FPGAs, Car / CAN hacking, low cost RF, educational talks and workshops, and mentoring the [Melbourne RoboCats](https://www.melbournerobocats.com/). 

I can also be found out for a run or on the local mountain bike trails trying to stay upright.

If you have any questions about anything I've worked on, or want to enquire about consulting availability, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@joshajohnson.com).
