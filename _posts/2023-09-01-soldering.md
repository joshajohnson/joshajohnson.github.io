One of the common questions I get after running a workshop where soldering is involved is "I want to do this at home, what gear do you recommend?" This page is here to answer the question.

Please note the suggestions here are targeted at someone who will solder every once in a while, if you do it regularly you may want to grab higher end equipment.

Good solder and flux is expensive but well worth the money.

Other tools and consumables don't have to break the bank.

A hot air station is a must for reworking surface mount components.
