Sea-Picro is a RP2040 based board in the Arduino Pro Micro form factor. Like [Sea-Micro]({% post_url 2022-08-04-sea-micro %}), it's designed to be a drop in replacement for keyboards wanting an upgrade from ATmega32u4 based pro micros.

Boards are currently in production, and will be available at [CustomKBD](https://customkbd.com/) when ready.

There are two variants:
- EXT, featuring an Elite-C pinout, with dedicated 5V RGB LED pin, but without a reset button.
- RST, featuring a pro micro pinout, with onboard RGB LED and reset button.

## Features
- Compatiable with any pro micro based keyboard (however requires new firmware)
- RP2040 microcontroller, with dual M0+ processors at up to 133MHz
- Mid mount USB-C connector, which is low profile and can't be ripped off
- Optional [Elite-C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Elite-C) style pinout, adding an additional 5 IO for large keyboards
- Single button reset / bootloader circuit which changes behaviour based on how long it's held (RP2040 usually requires two buttons to flash new firmware, making it challenging when installed upside down in a keyboard)
- ROM bootloader which prevents board from being bricked
- Onboard power LED, along with a WS2812 LED for use with CircuitPython / as a status indicator on the RST version. EXT version has a 5V level shifter and extra pin to drive strings of WS2812 LEDs.
- IO pinout identical to the [Sparkfun RP2040 Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288)
