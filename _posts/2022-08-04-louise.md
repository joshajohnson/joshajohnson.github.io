A project between Josh and RiotPunch to build a 75% alice keyboard with a southpaw numpad.
Running on a STM32 microcontroller, it has support for both normal and flipped numpad layouts, various lower row combinations, and underglow RGB.

## Documentation

All design files are available on [Github.](https://github.com/joshajohnson/louise)

The [release tab](https://github.com/joshajohnson/louise/releases/tag/r0.2) contains the qmk source files, VIA JSON, along with a VIAL precompiled binary.

Boards work with VIAL, head to [vial.rocks](https://vial.rocks/) or download [their configurator](https://get.vial.today/) to remap the board.

There are 4 status LEDs above the F5 - F8 keys that can be configured in the source code - not in VIAL.
By default LED 1 is a capslock LED, and LED 2 is an active low numlock LED.
