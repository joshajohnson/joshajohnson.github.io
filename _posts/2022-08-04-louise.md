A project between Josh and RiotPunch to build a 75% alice keyboard with a southpaw numpad.
Running on a STM32 microcontroller, it has support for both normal and flipped numpad layouts, various lower row combinations, and underglow RGB.

If you are interested, please add your details to [this form](https://forms.gle/jLW8V1EFUo1Jyc2c7) and I'll get in touch when units are available.

## Documentation

All design files are available on [Github.](https://github.com/joshajohnson/louise)

The [release tab](https://github.com/joshajohnson/louise/releases/tag/r0.2) contains the qmk source files, VIA JSON, along with a VIAL precompiled binary.

Boards ship with the VIAL keymap preflashed, head to [vial.rocks](https://vial.rocks/) or download [their configurator](https://get.vial.today/) to remap the board.

There are 4 status LEDs above the F5 - F8 keys that can be configured in the source code - not in VIAL.
By default LED 1 is a capslock LED, and LED 2 is an active low numlock LED.

Get in touch if you'd like me to modify the LEDs and send a binary over instead of compiling from source.
