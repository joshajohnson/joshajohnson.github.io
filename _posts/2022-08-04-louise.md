A project between Josh and RiotPunch to build a 75% alice keyboard with a southpaw numpad.
Running on a STM32 microcontroller, it has support for both normal and flipped numpad layouts, various lower row combinations, and underglow RGB.

It will be available for purchase on [CustomKBD](https://customkbd.com/) soon.

All design files are available on [Github.](https://github.com/joshajohnson/louise)
