A 96% Southpaw keyboard, with split space, encoder, and wireless support.

Entropy started as a STM32 powered keyboard running QMK and enclosed in a FR4 and PLA case, but has evolved into a nRF52 running ZMK, tucked inside a stacked acrylic case.

ZMK enables wireless functionality, and you'll get upwards of 6 months battery life thanks to the 200uA sleep current.

It also supports up to 4 rotary incoders in 5 different positions, along with a myriad of layout options.
